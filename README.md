**This project is an Appointment Booking System built with Spring Boot following a 3-layer architecture and SOLID principles. Users can securely register, log in, manage their passwords, and book, update, or cancel appointments, with all actions protected using JWT-based authentication. The system also integrates an email sender for password recovery, ensuring a smooth and secure user experience. The separation of concerns across controller, service, and repository layers makes the application maintainable, scalable, and aligned with clean coding best practices.**
